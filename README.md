The project was done as part of the NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 Kaggle competition on analyzing player movement data (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023).

Description:\
Hurry is a situation when the QB is forced to throw the ball earlier than intended or is chased around/out of the pocket as the result of defensive pressure. To prevent this, the offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. In our study of player movement data, we found statistical evidence that as the time a quarterback takes to make a decision decreases, the likelihood of a successful pass rises up.
